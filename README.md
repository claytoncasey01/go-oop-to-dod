# Object Oriented Programming to Data Oriented Programming

## Description
After seeing many talks on Data Oriented Programming but few examples on how to actually get started with it I decided to make this repo. The goal is to provide easy to digest examples in OOP as well as DOP. 

### Running
##### Benchmarks and Tests (Go )
        go test ./... -bench=. --benchmem

#### TODO
* ~~Go Examples~~
* Rust Examples
* Zig Examples
* C++ Examples
* Others (Kotlin, Typescript, Java, C#)?
